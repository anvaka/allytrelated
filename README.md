# allytrelated

A crawler for related youtube channels. Why not? Just playing with the data,
maybe nothing major (or maybe something very major).

It works by performing BFS on youtube channels starting from [TotalBiscuit channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/TotalHalibut).
This will cover ~3 million channels.

# data format

Once crawling is done the final file is written into `youtube-user.json`, which
will take ~700MB on the hard drive. Each record has the following format:

``` json
{
  "id": "UCy1Ms_5qBTawC-k7PVjHXKQ",
  "title": "TotalBiscuit, The Cynical Brit",
  "related": [
    "UC3kJdy9_bXFg8flaSY3RAcQ",
    "UCSvQyDawUyfXzrSq4dTVraQ",
    "UCvk51_ZhXooIukEKlbw08rA",
    "UCqZ0rqkoUeYlcxlUyqSgpdg",
    "UCCbfB3cQtkEAiKfdRQnfQvw",
    "UC_ufxdQbKBrrMOiZ4LzrUyA",
    "UC90ThxjTNaHaqyPVtfyZ4hw",
    "UCWCw2Sd7RlYJ2yuNVHDWNOA",
    "UCS2OAdHoLt-9T6cG9A2H49Q"
  ],
  "subscribers": "2,104,917",
  "relatedTitle": "Check out our colleagues"
}
```

Note: YouTube has couple `related` sections. By default this crawler will take
only the first one (most of the time the first section is generated by users).
