# Cluster debugger

This is the tool that I'm using to debug generated clusters.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron app for production
npm run build

# lint all JS/Vue component files in `app/src`
npm run lint

# run webpack in production
npm run pack
```
