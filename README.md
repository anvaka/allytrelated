A crawler for related youtube channels. Why not? Just playing with the data,
maybe nothing major.

Note: there is a bug in the current implementation which causes a memory leak
in OSX/Unix machines. Start the crawler under [forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever)
module. It will crawl enough pages before it fails and then it restarts.
